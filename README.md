# ascimg_

### A rich image to text converter.

This project is split into 3 parts: **CLI**, **API** and **WEB** versions. All of these use roughly the same Backend. You can find more details in `readme` located in each part's repo.

## ðŸ’» How to use?
* If you want to use user-friendly interface, checkout this project's [website](https://ascimg.ct8.pl/).
* There is also a **CLI** version of this project that you can easily download by following the instructions on it's repo.

## ðŸ¤– Algorithm.
**PROBLEM:** Convert image into ascii characters.

**SOLUTION:** Firstly, we must decide how are we going to treat image. Thankfully to PIL library, we can easily prepare a image by resizing and applying various filters on it. After this process (`prepare_image()` function) we can simply turn it into matrix made of pixels using `.load()` method. At this point, we can turn each pixel into character. But, how can we decide which pixel corresponds to an character? We know, that every pixel has a color represented in RGB values. By using `(R+G+B) /3` formula (`avg`) we get approximated brightness value. As the value will always be somewhere in between 0 and 255 (including both points) we know that, brightness of each pixel's brightness can be one of 256 values. This fact lets us build a scale where we split theese 256 values into groups where each group has a corresponding ASCII character. The main built in scale called `short` is this set of characters: `.:-=+*#%@`. As you can see, every next character takes a little bit more space than previous one. Using fact that, we can get pixel's brightness and roughly represent it as a character, we must build a scale that connects some values into a character. For example, pixel with brightness equal to 0 is completly black and "invisible", so we can treat it exactly as a space character. In fact, we don't have (however, we can) to assign a individual character for every value, but we can assign group of values into one character (as a pixel with brithness equal to 20 looks almost the same as a pixel with brightness level at 28 and by converting image into text, we don't really expect 1:1 quality.) That's where we are going to use simple algorithm for converting normal text (like one in `short` scale) into groups of values with associated character. To start, we need to check how much characters do we have to assign. For example, `short` scale contains `10` characters. Than we can calculate `step`'s value by simple division: `256/scale_length`. To ensure, that there will be no floting point value, we will round result of this division and as brightness scale starts from 0, we will add  1 to outcome. Final formula for calculating `step`: `round(256/scale_length)+1`. Now, we can assign characters to range of numbers in between current step and next step. Using `for range_index in range(-1, 256, step)` we can jump by `step` numbers up to 256. To group numbers, we can create built in `range` object that starts with current value: `range_index +1` and leads up to value of next step: `range_index + step +1`. And that's how we get dictionary of `range: character` values. When we know which brightness values accords to which character, we can finally iterate over each pixel of image, calculate its brightness and get corresponding ASCII character.
